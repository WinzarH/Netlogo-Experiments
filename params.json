Using an exact replication, using different software, I found quite different results from those reported in the original paper. It has taken me on a journey.\r\n\r\n>Goldenberg, J., Libai, B., Muller, E., 2001. “Talk of the Network: A Complex Systems Look at the Underlying Process of Word-of-Mouth,” _Marketing Letters_, Vol. 12 (3), pp. 211-223.\r\n\r\n## These programs\r\nPrograms here are for a working paper provisionally titled:\r\n\r\n**A Replication and Extension of Goldenberg, Libai & Muller: Demonstrating a complex systems approach to developing and testing theory**\r\n\r\n---\r\nUpdates can be found here (@WinzarH) \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
